## General Information
- This project was made to for testing Python Tkinter's GUI.
- It's a simple calculator that solves basic operations.
- I made this project during Summer 2021 and was interested in making an application mixed with mathematics.

## Features
The features I used from Tkinter's GUI Library:
- Label
- Button
- Frame
- Messagebox
- Gridding and Packing System

The features that are supplied by the calculator:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_

## Personal Notes
This project took some time because I had to construct the algorithm for a calculator application.

If you want to change the background color of the application you can change the color hexcode (#) on

'self.configure(background='#7C83FD')' on line 16.

This calculator only takes in *one operator* at a time, meaning that if you continuously click the operators for numerous times,

the *first* operator clicked will be used for computing the result (upon clicking '=').

## Room for Improvement
I would like to implement percentage, the availability of decimal, and unary plus minus.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired from a TikToker who majored in Computer Science.
